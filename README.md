# Air-Quality-Monitor
Overview
This project involves an Air Quality Monitor system built using an Arduino UNO that reads analog signals from a gas sensor, converts them into digital values, and compares the readings against predefined thresholds. The gas concentration levels are displayed on an LCD screen for easy monitoring.

# Features
Gas Sensor Integration: Reads analog signals from the gas sensor to detect air quality.
Threshold Comparison: Compares sensor readings to predefined thresholds to evaluate gas concentration levels.
LCD Display: Shows real-time gas concentration levels on an LCD screen, providing a visual representation of the air quality.

# Components Used
Arduino UNO: The microcontroller used to control the system.
Gas Sensor: Detects the concentration of specific gases in the air.
LCD Screen: Displays the gas concentration levels in real-time.
Breadboard & Jumper Wires: For wiring the components together.

# How It Works
The gas sensor outputs analog signals corresponding to the gas concentration levels in the air.
The Arduino UNO reads these analog signals and converts them into digital values.
The digital values are compared against predefined thresholds to determine whether the gas concentration is low, moderate, or high.
The results are then displayed on the LCD screen for real-time monitoring of the air quality.

# Installation and Setup
Wiring:
Connect the gas sensor to the Arduino's analog input pin (e.g., A0).

# Future Improvements
Add a buzzer or LED indicator to alert users when dangerous gas levels are detected.
Implement data logging to track air quality over time.
Enhance sensor accuracy by calibrating thresholds based on environmental conditions.

# License
This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
Wire the LCD display to the appropriate pins on the Arduino (following standard LCD wiring protocols).
Arduino Code:
Upload the provided Arduino sketch (air_quality_monitor.ino) to your Arduino UNO using the Arduino IDE.

# Thresholds:
In the code, modify the predefined threshold values based on your specific gas sensor type and sensitivity.
